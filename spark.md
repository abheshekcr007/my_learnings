what is the need for data engineers in todays world??  
why do we need these professionals..  

if data is used efficiently ..we can achieve operational efficiency ..  
this improves customer experience..which in turn boosts customer satisfaction ..  
this increase trust in the brand ..  which in turn leads to increased sales and profits..  

Walmart uses big data to predict the demand for stocks and stock it up in appropriate stores before hand  
and hence when a customer walks in to the store ..he find the product and buys it ..  
satisfied ..  
and increased sales and profits  ..

so like these there are n number of use cases for data  ..

but if this data is not always in a really good consumable format   
it will be in all soughts of places  
it needs to be orchestrated and brought to a central place  
this data will be huge so we need to go for big data processing  spark batch and streaming  
to store transformed data we need something called data warehouse  
to transform this data there will be tools ..

so end to end need to be aware of ..how to get this data..  
how to appropriately store it ..  
and how to tranform it in a way that could be consumed by thr down stream teams for machine learning and analytics purposes..



git history
we can use git head~2  git head^2  git head {1 month ago }  to know the parents of present commits  
git head {1 month ago} tells me where the head was 1 month commit ..to which commit it was pointing to .
